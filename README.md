What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, the main problem I was solving in the projects was to develop advising assistance software for the academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. The software needed to be able to print and sort course data from a CSV file in alphanumeric order. Other functions included loading data into the CSV file, which was the most important part since the software cannot function without data being loaded into it. The software needed to provide ABCU's advisors with easy access to course data. This problem was complex since it involved reading course data such as course prerequisites and IDs, and adding them to a course list in the program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first approached the problem by breaking it into smaller pieces. It was an important first step to understand the structure of the data. The structure for this project included course ID, course name, and prerequisites, if any. Once I got a good understanding of the structure, I then moved on to choosing the proper data structure. Data structures are important to understand because the performance of a program directly depends on choosing the right data structure. By choosing the proper data structure, I was able to ensure that my program was as efficient as possible.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A major roadblock I encountered was during the actual programming phase of the project, where I was trying to design a program that was as efficient as possible. Initially, I had trouble organizing the program, especially in my function where I sorted the data. When I first started writing my code, I was bunching my functions together and my code started getting disorganized. To fix this, I created separate functions for each task.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
