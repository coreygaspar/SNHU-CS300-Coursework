**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In this course, the main problem I was solving in the projects was to develop advising assistance software for the academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. The software needed to be able to print and sort course data from a CSV file in alphanumeric order. Other functions included loading data into the CSV file, which was the most important part since the software cannot function without data being loaded into it. The software needed to provide ABCU's advisors with easy access to course data. This problem was complex since it involved reading course data such as course prerequisites and IDs, and adding them to a course list in the program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
